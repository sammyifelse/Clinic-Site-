# 🏥 Shifa Clinic Official Website

This project is the official website for Shifa Clinic, designed to digitize and streamline patient registration and improve overall clinic efficiency. It features a database-driven registration system, secure authentication using JWT, and a user-friendly interface.

## Project Description 📝

The primary goal of this project was to transform Shifa Clinic's traditional registration process into a fully digital, database-driven platform. This transition allows patients to register online, significantly reducing paperwork and enhancing the efficiency of the registration process for both the clinic staff and patients.

To ensure secure access and data protection, JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication was implemented, providing authorized access for doctors and staff while safeguarding patient data.
